# Proposals on Educational Safety

## Introduction

Conventional discussions on education safety cover physical safety, personal safety, and mental health safety, and the topics are more about the safety of teaching during the education process.
This proposal explores the topic of education safety from another perspective.
The focus of education safety in a broad sense should be on the safety of education content and form.
The main topics discussed are the following
1. Scientific research integrity, education integrity
2. Education background and education material safety
3. Education norms and education process prevention
4. Invisible education safety

### Scientific research integrity, education integrity

Scientific research integrity has always been an important topic in the academic field. Because of its high attention and resource-intensiveness, the safety of this field has also been given great attention.

### Education background and education material safety

The content of textbooks and textbook compilation, textbook writing supply chain security, etc. involves content security, ideological security, display form security, etc., and its content is very wide. Such problems may not arise in places where publications are regulated, but the content they display is difficult to fully monitor.

### Education norms and education process prevention

This topic refers to the safety of the educational process, emphasizing more on physical safety and the involvement of other contents in the educational process.

Contemporary education believes that the main aspects of education are school education, family education and social education. People at different ages receive different aspects and proportions of education, among which social education is the most dangerous and needs extra attention.

### Invisible education safety

Invisible education refers to the safety of non-formal content presented in society, such as social hot spots, social trends, cultural trends, ideologies, works, publications, and other content that does not appear in formal educational scenarios.

Generally speaking, this part covers a very wide range of content and is very important.
